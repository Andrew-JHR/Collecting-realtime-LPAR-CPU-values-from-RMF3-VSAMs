# Collecting-realtime-LPAR-CPU-values-from-RMF3-VSAMs
This tool collects more granular CPU figures from RMF III than the Post Processer from RMF I â€“ RMF III provides CPU utilization figures for much shorter period of time than RMF I -- in a manner of automatically accumulating these more granular CPU utilization figures to a sequential file.
